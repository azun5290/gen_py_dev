# gen_py_dev

Informations
------------
general python tools for IO, dir. services, data manipulation, etc.

First tiny_proj is essentially a proposal to speed up a small python project, where the goal is:

Given an export file which can either come in CSV or Excel (.xlsx) format, the requirements are that the small python app (console OK, actually preferable but .exe production may be a +), one of the columns containining multiline text, needs to be parsed in a precise manner

Usage
----- 
```
python gen_by_dev.py INPUT_FILE OUTPUT_FILE
```
