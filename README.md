# gen_py_dev
Informations
============

general python tools for IO, dir. services, data manipulation, etc.

Repository created to showcase initial code for small projects to UpWork candidates

First tiny_proj is essentially a proposal to speed up a small python project, where the goal is:

Given an export file which can either come in CSV or Excel (.xlsx) format, the requirements are that the small python app (console OK, actually preferable but .exe production may be a +), one of the columns containining multiline text, needs to be parsed in a precise manner, the specifics of which will be outlined in the UpWork brief

Usage
=====
python gen_by_dev.py <input_file> <output_file>
